This is the github repo for my blog website. It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme is [hermit-v2](https://github.com/1bl4z3r/hermit-V2).

## Todo

- [ ] Provide options to fold all code blocks in front matter

    This is because some of the leetcode note contains long codes, making it hard to read.

    Either there is a feature in hermit v2 that does this, or we will have to implement it ourselves.
