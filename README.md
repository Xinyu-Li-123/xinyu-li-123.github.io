This is the github repo for my blog website. It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme is a customized version of [Hermit-V2](https://github.com/1bl4z3r/hermit-V2), which is tracked in [this repo](https://github.com/Xinyu-Li-123/customized-hermit-V2/tree/main).

## Tips

To create posts in VSCode, you can install the [Insert Date String](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsynowiec.vscode-insertdatestring) extension, so that it's easier to fill in the `date` attribute in the front matter of the post.
