This is the github repo for my blog website. It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme is [hermit-v2](https://github.com/1bl4z3r/hermit-V2).

## Todo

- [ ] Provide options to fold all code blocks in front matter

    This is because some of the leetcode note contains long codes, making it hard to read.

    Either there is a feature in hermit v2 that does this, or we will have to implement it ourselves.

- [*] For each "folder", list the most recent 3 posts in that folder.

## Tips

To create posts in VSCode, you can install the [Insert Date String](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsynowiec.vscode-insertdatestring) extension, so that it's easier to fill in the `date` attribute in the front matter of the post.
