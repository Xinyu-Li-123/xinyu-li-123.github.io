title: 'Common Design Pattern in Compute System'
---

Some design pattern appears in very different subfield of Computer Science. This post is a list of such patterns.

## Cache

## Pipeline

## Separation of Control Path and Data Path

In digital circuit, in distributed system (e.g. GFS), etc.

## Pool

Thread pool in server, Buffer pool in database

Pre-allocate resource from system in advance, and use a data structure to let others obtain and release resource without construction / destruction.

Centralized management, good for ???
