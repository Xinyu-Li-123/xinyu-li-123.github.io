About half a year ago, I switched from Vim to LazyVim. The experience so far is great: nice UI, nice tools like rg and lazygit. However, I haven't spent much time on learning how LazyVim work (because I'm lazy :D). All I have done is going over [the official LazyVim website](https://www.lazyvim.org/) and the introduction video ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N93cTbtLCIM), [BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DEy3YvEbb)). Maybe chat with GPT if I want some customized plugins / configs, but nothing more than that. Heck, I don't even know how to run a hello world lua program. In this post, I will go over the stuff a Vim user needs to know to understand how LazyVim work. It will cover a quick start on Lua, NeoVim, and finally LazyVim.

## Lua

### Basic syntax

### Table

### `require()` and module

How path resolution works in lua

## NeoVim

### Config

### Plugin

## LazyVim
