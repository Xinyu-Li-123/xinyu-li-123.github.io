This is a cheatsheet for IntelliJ Idea. It lists commonly-used keyboard shortcuts, useful plugins, and some tricks of working with IntelliJ Idea.

## Keyboard Shortcut

Since I have IdeaVim plugin installed, there will always be conflcit between Idea's keyboard shortcut and Vim's keyboard shortcut. I consider this to be a form of trade-off: I keep what I use most frequently on both side. For example, I may keep Vim's `<C-c>` ("Ctrl" and "C") shortcut, which switch from insert mode to normal mode, instead of Idea's one that copy selected text. Because I'm more familiar with switching Vim's mode with that shortcut, and IdeaVim already provide `"+y` to copy text.
