I'm going to start an internship that uses Java. When learning Java, I find that, unlike languages like C or Rust, it's quite complicated (but not hard) to get a Java project running in the command line without using an IDE. I remember once got a single bash command generated by IntelliJ Idea that spans 100 lines after some reformatting.

To avoid over-reliance on IDE or non-official tools like Maven, I believe the best way is to do everything the hard way: run everything from scratch, with no help of an IDE.
