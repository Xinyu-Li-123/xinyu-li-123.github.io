Makefile is a nice and general tool to automate the build process of a project of any language, but we have something that are designed specifically for Java project.

For simplicity, we will only focus on Maven. The underlying idea should be directly transferable to other tools like Gradle.

It's nice to understand the nitty-gritty details of the underlying mechanism of Java workflow. But in production, these are all automated and hidden by an Integrated Development Environment. Learning how to efficiently use them in equally important as understanding what they are doing in the background. In this section, we will discuss three choices: IntelliJ Idea, VSCode, and NeoVim.

I guess I will just go for IntelliJ Idea during my Internship, since that's the most mature solution. But it's always nice to have some open-source alternatives. Plus, configuring NeoVim and working on a Java program in vim-like environment just keep my mind sharp.
