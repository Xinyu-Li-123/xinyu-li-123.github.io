This post is a collection of links to posts / papers mentioned in the book that I find could be interesting to read. It would break the flow of reading if I follow these links whenever I encounter them, but it would also be a shame if I just ignore them. So the best way is to just save them here, and read them later.

The links are organized by the chapters in which they appear.

## Chapter 01
