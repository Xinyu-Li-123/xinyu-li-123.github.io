This is a series of reading note of the book [*Streaming Systems*](http://www.streamingbook.net/where-to-buy). All figures in the posts below, if not specified otherwise, are cited from the [book's website](http://www.streamingbook.net/)

Other that the book, here are some paper that seems to be worth-reading

- [Watermarks in stream processing systems: semantics and comparative analysis of Apache Flink and Google cloud dataflow](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3476311.3476389)

  Topic: watermark

  Reason: Written by the author of the book to introduce watermark, but in year 2021, later than the book's publishment. Hopefully would facilitate our understanding of streaming systems.
